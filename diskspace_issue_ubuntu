example 200GB LVM utilising half the disk, which is the default when you install ubuntu server for example.

# vgdisplay

VG Size               <199.00 GiB
Alloc PE / Size       25472 / 99.50 Gib
Free  PE / Size       25471 / <99.50 GiB


# lsblk

└─sda3                      8:3    0   199G  0 part
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0  99.5G  0 lvm
Find the path name of your LVM:

# lvdisplay
Mine is /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

You can allocate all free space to the existing space with this: Obviosuly you should have a backup of your data before doing this.

# lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
After this completes check "vgdisplay" to verify the space has been allocated.

This is what it looks like after:

# vgdisplay

  VG Size               <199.00 GiB
  Alloc PE / Size       50943 / <199.00 GiB
  Free  PE / Size       0 / 0
The file system is still going to be the same size though, it needs to be extended too. Mine is EXT4.

Inspect:

# df -hT

Filesystem                        Type   Size  Used Avail Use%
/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ext4    98G  5.1G   88G   6%
Run resize2fs to expand the ext4 filesystem to fill the VG

# resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
This is what is looks like after:

# df -hT

Filesystem                        Type   Size  Used Avail Use%
/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv ext4   196G  5.1G  182G   3% /
My 200GB LVM is now completely utilised.
